# LSTM

This post is an abridged version of a paper I wrote some time ago. It provides a thorough derivation of the LSTM network, based upon the framework set out by Sherstinsky (2018).  This step is generally skipped in finance deep learning literature featuring the LSTM.  This post therefore provides a bridge between finance DL literature and the denser theoretical treatment of RNNs and the LSTM in the broader DL literature.
