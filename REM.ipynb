    "I compare two complex non-linear state space models: the first, a deep learning neural network, the long short-term memory (LSTM); the second, a Markov-switching multifractal stochastic volatility model. I analyze their comparative out-of-sample forecasting performance using high frequency equity and foreign exchange data in which I suppress the microstructure noise. The data covers the period January 2018 to March 2020 and includes extreme volatility regimes (the most extreme since the late 1920's) induced by markets' initial response to COVID-19. I implement a deep LSTM and $\\mathrm{MSM} \\left( 13 \\right)$ with 8192 volatility states; as a result, both models invoke extremely large state spaces. Results show that, due to its inherent non-linearity, LSTM discovers, in an unsupervised manner, the different volatility regimes and provides reasonable out-of-sample performance, broadly consistent with literature. $\\mathrm{MSM} \\left( 13 \\right)$, however, provides comparatively better forecasts than LSTM in almost all tests at 1-hour, 1-day, and 2-day horizons for equity HF (Apple and J.P.Morgan) and foreign exchange HF (EURUSD) returns series. I attribute these findings primarily to $\\mathrm{MSM} \\left( \\bar k \\right)$'s stronger underlying theoretical structure (i.e. the multifractal volatility approach better accounts for the stylized facts: almost unpredictable returns, fat tails, and volatility clustering) and $\\mathrm{MSM} \\left( 13 \\right)$'s superior fittingness to a large univariate time-series of HF data in which microstructure noise is suppressed. My research extends the multifractal literature in three ways.  Firstly, I compare a deep learning model to a multifractal model, theoretically and empirically, and show that the deep learning and multifractal approaches have many similarities. The forward pass and backward propagation algorithms of the LSTM analogize to the transition matrix and Bayesian recursion of the $\\mathrm{MSM} \\left( \\bar k \\right)$, whilst the LSTM gradient descent training procedure analogizes to the basin-hopping optimization framework in my implementation of $\\mathrm{MSM} \\left( \\bar k \\right)$. Secondly, I provide a thorough derivation of the LSTM network, based upon the framework set out by Sherstinsky (2018, 2020). This step is generally skipped in finance deep learning literature featuring the LSTM. I thus provide a bridge between finance DL literature and the denser theoretical treatment of RNNs and the LSTM in the broader DL literature. By leveraging Sherstinsky (2020) I am able to describe the LSTM to a level of detail that enables (re-)construction of all its algorithms without recourse to an opensource deep learning framework. Thirdly, I compare both models within the setting of big data, using a very large HF time series that has been thoroughly cleansed and prepared and features extreme volatility regimes. These insights and contributions provide a structured framework for further comparisons of data-centric methods from the machine learning canon to multifractal methods, with an obvious candidate for further research being multivariate settings, predicting relations expected to be nonlinear, such as between realized volatility and its determinants.\n",

    "The human brain is a recurrent neural network (RNN): a network of neurons with feedback connections. It may learn many behaviors (sequence processing tasks, algorithms, programs) that may not be learned by non-human methods (financial models, for example) methods. Thus the rapidly growing interest in artificial RNNs: general computers which can learn algorithms to map input sequences to output sequences, with or without a teacher. Recent applications beyond finance include adaptive robotics and control, autonomous vehicle propulsion, image recognition, music composition, attentive vision, protein analysis, and many other sequence problems. Recent applications within finance traverse price and volatility prediction, hedging and portfolio optimization, analysis of risks, along with a wide range of anomaly detections (fraud, anti-money laundering, sanctions violations, terrorist financing, cyber-security breaches). \n",

    "Most applications of machine learning focus upon models of reactive behavior. RNNs, however, are more general sequence processors. They have adaptive feedback connections and are in principle as powerful as any computer. Early RNNs could not learn to look far back into the past due to vanishing (or exploding gradients). Their problems were first rigorously analyzed by Hochreiter (1991). A feedback network called the 'long short-term memory' (LSTM), proposed by Hochreiter & Schmidhuber (1997), overcame the fundamental problems of traditional RNNs, and efficiently learned to solve many previously unlearnable tasks (see for example Greff, Srivastava, Koutnik, Steunebrink & Schmidhuber (2017), Graves, Liwicki, Fernandez, Bertolami, Bunke & Schmidhuber (2009), Gomez, Schmidhuber & Miikkulainen (2008), Mayer, Gomez, Wierstra, Nagy, Knoll & Schmidhuber (2008), Schmidhuber, Wierstra, Gagliolo & Gomez (2007), Graves & Schmidhuber (2005), Perez-Ortiz, Gers, Eck & Schmidhuber (2003), Schmidhuber, Gers & Eck (2002), Gers, Schraudolph, & Schmidhuber (2002), Gers, Schmidhuber, & Cummins (2000)). LSTM RNNs learn through gradient descent (GD).\n",

    "Minsky (1963) described a so-called fundamental credit assignment problem, in which he asked: Which modifiable components of a learning system are responsible for its success or failure? And, what changes to them improve performance? My research is set within an important subfield of general credit assignment methods, that of deep learning (DL) in RNNs. I apply DL to a canonical finance problem, that of accurately forecasting volatility when armed with a time series of returns. Learning, or credit assignment, is described by Schmidhuber (2015, 2013) as being about finding weights that make RNNs exhibit desired behavior (a useful volatility forecast, for example). Depending upon the problem and how the neurons are connected, such behavior may require long causal chains of computational stages, where each stage transforms, often in a non-linear way, the aggregate activation of the network. DL is the process of accurately assigning credit across many such stages.\n",

    "I devote considerable effort to a theoretical enunciation of LSTM, to set the scene for its comparison to MSM in the empirical study. A thorough derivation of the LSTM network is generally skipped in finance deep learning literature that features the LSTM, so that it is not possible to (re-)construct a model solely  from the mathematics provided by these papers. The major open source machine learning frameworks offer efficient, production-ready implementations of a number of deep learning models, including RNN and LSTM (see for example Abadi, M., Agarwal, A., Barham, P., Brevdo, E., Chen, Z., Citro, C., Corrado, G.

(2019), Pytorch, https://pytorch.org/). Researchers may opt to take advantage of this access, so that studies proceed quickly to empirical applications of deep learning, supported by select formulas and routines, but omitting key steps and details, such as unrolling, the inference equations (i.e. the forward pass), the training equations (i.e. the backward pass), learning through GD, and complete descriptions of architecture.\n",

    "By contrast, I seek to understand each aspect of the operation of RNN and LSTM's elegant and effective systems in considerable depth. I believe that the advantage of the lengthier path I take is that it affords much greater opportunity to compare DL to other nonlinear state space models, specifically MSM, whilst proffering much greater insight.  I therefore describe firstly the RNN, followed by its evolution to the LSTM form, much more completely than is usually the case in finance DL papers, showing in detail the key operations I build in the empirical study in order to predict a financial time series.  These include unrolling the RNN, the motivations for the LSTM, namely managing the phenomena of vanishing gradients, and the subsequent mechanics of learning, which are the forward and backward passes and gradient descent.\n",

    "Few papers in the literature appear to do this systematically and comprehensively, and the best treatment I have found is that of Sherstinsky (2018, 2020). As with much of the most useful empirical DL literature, Sherstinsky's papers are not finance papers and considerable work is required to transcribe the most relevant aspects of it to a finance setting. Sherstinsky (2020) uses a signal processing framework and notation from engineering and life sciences. He derives a canonical RNN set up and, within this framework, explains RNN unrolling. I show in section 5, Model, that a neural network at the simplest level of abstraction takes an input, $x_t$, log returns specifically in the case of this paper, and outputs a value, in practice represented in a normalized form. The loop (i.e. the 'recurrent' aspect) of the RNN allows information to be passed sequentially through steps of the neural network, from one step to the next, thus creating a structure for sequential learning.  I unroll a RNN, following the framework of Sherstinsky (2020), to reveal its chain-like nature and intimate relation to sequences. Viewed in this way, the RNN is an obvious and compelling candidate for time series analysis. I then proceed to describe fully the training routines, FP, BP and GD, along with the numerical phenomenon of vanishing gradients, first described by Schmidhuber's student, Hochreiter in his PhD thesis (1991), and subsequently addressed in the seminal LSTM paper of Hochreiter & Schmidhuber (1997). Sherstinsky provides a particularly complete enunciation of FP, BP, and GD, which I follow.  However, his overall framework is not particularly helpful from a finance perspective and considerable work is required to unpick it so that it readily ties back to the generally far briefer presentations that typify finance DL papers. Throughout I use a univariate input signal, in order to align this paper with the setting in my companion paper (Collins (2020)).\n",

    "Shallow NN-like models with relatively few neuron connections (thus computational stages) have been around for many decades, if not centuries.  Early NN architectures (see for example, McCulloch & Pitts (1943)) did not learn.  Early formulations of unsupervised learning (UL) were published a few years later (Hebb (1949)). The following decades saw simple NNs trained by supervised learning (SL) (see for example, Narendra & Thathatchar (1974), Widrow & Hoff (1962), and Rosenblatt (1958, 1962)) and UL (Willshaw & von der Malsburg (1976), von der Malsburg (1973), Kohonen (1972), and Grossberg (1969)). But it may be argued that NNs were formulated earlier, since early supervised NNs were essentially variants of linear regression methods introduced at the start of the seventeenth century (for example Gauss (1809, 1821), and Legendre (1805)).\n",

    "Models with several successive nonlinear layers of neurons were introduced in the 1960's (see for example Ivakhnenko (1968, 1971),  Ivakhnenko, Lapa & McDonough (1967), and Ivakhnenko & Lapa (1965)) and minimization of errors through GD  (Hadamard (1908) in the parameter space of complex, nonlinear, differentiable, multi-stage, NN-related systems were also introduced from this time (for example Director & Rohrer (1969), Bryson & Ho (1969), Amari (1967), Wilkinson (1965), Dreyfus (1962), Bryson & Denham (1961), Pontryagin, Boltyanskii, Gamrelidze & Mishchenko (1961), Bryson (1961), and Kelley (1960)). Efficient GD  methods for SL in discrete, differentiable networks of arbitrary depth called back propagation (BP) were developed in the 1960's and 1970's, and applied to NN's from the early 1980's (see for example LeCun (1988, 1985), Parker (1985), and Werbos (1981)). BP-based training of deep NNs with many layers, however, had been found to be difficult in practice by the late 1980's and it seemed clear that BP by itself suffered quite serious limitations (see Goodfellow, Bengio & Courville (2016) for a review). Networks trained by the group method of data handling (GMDH) Ivakhnenko (1968, 1971),  Ivakhnenko, Lapa & McDonough (1967), and Ivakhnenko & Lapa (1965)) were perhaps the first DL systems of the feed-forward multilayer perceptron type. The units of GMDH NNs had more polynomial activation functions implementing Kolmogorov-Gabor polynomials and were thus more general than other widely used NN activation functions. Given a training set, layers were incrementally grown and trained by regression analysis, then reduced with the help of a separate validation set, using decision regularization to eliminate superfluous units. The numbers of layers and units per layer were learned in problem-dependent modalities. GMDH NNs thus constituted perhaps the first examples of open-ended, hierarchical representation learning with DL (see Schmidhuber (2015) and Russell, Norvig, Canny, Malik, & Edwards (1995) for reviews).\n",

    "NNs with many layers had, by the 1990's, become an explicit research subject. Following from the difficulties encountered training deep feed-forward recurrent NNs (RNNs) by BP, Hochreiter (1991) formally identified a major reason: typical deep NNs suffer from so-called vanishing (or exploding) gradients. Hochreiter (1991) showed that with standard activation functions, cumulative back-propagated error signals either shrink rapidly, or grow out of bounds. In fact they decay exponentially with the number of layers, or they explode. This phenomenon was also described as the long time lag problem (see for example Bengio, Simard & Frasconi (1994)). Much subsequent research, particularly in the 1990's and 2000's, was motivated by this insight (see for example Pascanu, Mikolov & Bengio (2013), Hochreiter, Bengio, Paolo & Schmidhuber (2001), Hochreiter & Schmidhuber (1997)).\n",

    "DL became practically feasible to some extent through the help of UL. Schmidhumber (2013, 1992) showed that a working 'very deep learner' could perform credit assignment across hundreds of nonlinear operators or neural layers, by using unsupervised pre-training for a hierarchy of RNNs. Schmidhuber showed that the RNN stack may be considered as essentially a deep generative model of the data. Adding another RNN to the stack improved a bound on the data's description length, equivalent to the negative logarithm of its probability (this followed Huffman (1952), and Shannon (1948)), for as long as there is remaining local learnable predictability in the data representation on the corresponding level of the hierarchy. The system was shown to be able to learn many previously unlearnable DL tasks. Stacks of RNNs were used in later work on SL with considerable success, leading not least to the seminal supervised long short-term memory (LSTM) RNN (Perez-Ortiz, Gers, Eck, & Schmidhuber (2003), and Gers, Schmidhuber & Cummins (2000), and Hochreiter & Schmidhuber (1997)). \n",

    "Whilst learning networks with numerous non-linear layers can therefore be seen to date back at least to the 1960's, and explicit DL research results have been published since at least the early 1990's, the expression 'deep learning' only emerged in the mid-2000's, when unsupervised pre-training of deep FNNs helped to accelerate subsequent SL through BP (for example, Hinton, Osindero & Teh (2006), and Hinton & Salakhutdinov (2006)). The 1990's and 2000's also saw many improvements of purely supervised DL, so that many contemporaneous practical applications by researchers and practitioners alike continued to focus upon SL. Several methods, however, used additional UL to facilitate SL. These included the use of recursive auto-associative memory (RAAM) as unsupervised pre-processors to facilitate deep credit assignment for reinforcement learning (RL) (Sutton & Barto (2018) provide a detailed review of RL). Deep NNs became progressively more relevant for RL, where there is no supervising teacher. Schmidhuber (2015) argued that it is beneficial to consider SL and UL together for both scholarly and practical purposes because often gradient-based methods, such as BP, were used to optimize the objective functions of both UL and SL, so that the boundaries between SL and UL may be blurred in many respects. This may be particularly so in the case of time series forecasting.\n",

    "A NN's topology may change over time (see for example Goodfellow, Bengio, & Courville (2016) and Schmidhuber (2015)). But at any given moment, it may be described as a finite subset of units (also, nodes or neurons) $N = \\{u_1, u_2, ..., \\}$ and a finite set $H \\subseteq N \\times N$ of directed edges (or connections) between nodes. The first (i.e. input) layer is the set of input units, a subset of $N$. In FNNs, the $k$-th layer $\\left( k > 1 \\right)$ is the set of all nodes $u \\in N$ such that there is an edge path of length $k - 1$ (but no longer path) between some input unit and $u$. There may be shortcut connections between distant layers. The NNs behavior (or program) is determined by a set of real-valued, possibly modifiable, parameters (or weights) $w_i \\left( i = 1, 2, ..., n \\right)$. A single finite episode of information processing and activation spreading, initially without learning through weight changes, is called an epoch. During an epoch, there is a partially causal sequence $x_t \\left( t = 1, 2, ..., T \\right)$ of real-valued events. Each $x_t$ is either an input set by the environment, or the activation of a unit that may directly depend on other $x_k \\left( k < t \\right)$ through a current NN topology-dependent set ${in}_t$ of indices $k$ representing incoming causal connections or links. Let the function $v$ encode topology information and map such event index pairs $\\left( k, t \\right)$ to weight indices. For example, in the non-input case I may have $x_t = f_t \\left( \\mathrm{net}_t \\right)$ with real-valued $\\mathrm{net}_t = \\sum_{k \\in {in}_t} x_k w_{v \\left(k, t \\right)}$ (additive case) or $\\mathrm{net}_t = \\prod_{k \\in {in}_t} x_k w_{v \\left(k, t \\right)}$ (multiplicative case), where $f_t$ is a typically nonlinear real-valued activation function (for example, $\\mathrm{tanh}$). In this set up, many of the $x_t$ may refer to different, time-varying activations of the same unit (see for example Williams (1989)). During an epoch, the same weight may get reused repeatedly in topology-dependent ways. Schmidhuber (2015) describes this as 'weight sharing across space and/or time'. \n",

A typical goal of supervised NN training is to find weights that yield epochs with small total error, $E$, being the sum of $e_t$. The goal is that the NN will generalize well in later epochs, leading to progressively smaller errors on previously unseen sequences of input events.

Higher-order NNs simulate a deterministic finite state machine and may be considered a multiplicative structure of inputs and the most recent hidden state (see for example Giles, Sun, Chen, Lee, & Chen (1989)). Tensor NNs have allowed different hidden-to-hidden weight matrices for every input dimension (see for example Sutskever, Martens, & Hinton (2011)). Higher-order NNs have concatenated a sequence of past hidden states, although the underlying state interactions were linear (see Soltani & Jiang (2016)).  Hierarchical NNs (see Zheng, Yue & Lucey (2016)) have been used to model sequential data at multiple temporal resolutions and earlier work has recently been generalized to capture higher-order interactions using a hidden-to-hidden tensor (see Yu, Zheng, Anandkumar & Yue (2019)).\n",

The above model does not explicitly capture higher-order dynamics and only implicitly encodes long-term dependencies between all historical states $h_0, h_1, ..., h_t$. This limits the representation power of NNs, especially for forecasting in environments with nonlinear dynamics.

    "Real-world sequences may have long range dependencies that cannot be captured by Markov models, but NNs lack the interpretability that state space models enjoy. Thus, enhancing state space models with NNs is both natural and has quite a rich history. Traditional approaches can be traced back to nonlinear extensions of linear dynamical systems, such as extended or unscented Kalman filters (for example see Julier & Uhlmann, 1997), where both state transition and emission are generalized to nonlinear functions. The idea of parameterization using NNs is at least as early as Ghahramani & Roweis (1999), and is more extensively used in the last decade (for example Karl, Soelch, Bayer & van der Smagt (2017), Krishnan, Shalit & Sontag (2017), Johnson, Duvenaud, Wiltschko, Datta & Adams (2016), Krishnan, Shalit & Sontag (2015), Archer, Park, Buesing, Cunningham & Paninski (2015), Kingma & Welling, 2014 and Rezende, Mohamed & Wierstra (2014)). Enriching the output distribution of NNs with multinomial output or mixture density networks dates from Bishop (1994).  In the last decade more flexible distributions have been used, including restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM) (see Boulanger-Lewandowski, Bengio & Vincent (2012)), along with variational auto-encoders (VAE) (see for example Gregor, Danihelka, Graves, Rezende & Wierstra (2015) and Chung, Kastner, Dinh, Goel, Courville & Bengio (2015)). \n",
    "Also in the last decade stochasticity has been applied to NNs. Bayer & Osendorfer (2014) and Pachitariu & Sahani (2012) incorporated independent latent variables at each time step and NNs have been attached to both latent states and observations (see for example Fraccaro, Sønderby, Paquet & Winther (2016)).\n",

    "Research focused specifically upon volatility forecasting by deep learners started somewhat later, in the 1990's. Early volatility studies used NNs to forecast implied volatilities after training on past volatilities and other options market factors (see for example Roh (2007), Malliaris & Salchenberger (1996) and Donaldson & Kamstra (1996a, 1996b)). This early literature generally compared NNs to GARCH (see for example Maciel, Gomide & Ballini (2016) and Hajizadeh, Seifi, Fazel Zarandi & Turksen (2012)). The usefulness of a semi-nonparametric neural network-GARCH model to capture nonlinear relationships was demonstrated (see Donaldson & Kamstra (1997); it is noteworthy that benchmark NNs were shown to provide superior performance in this research). Shortly after, Hu & Tsoukalas (1999) combined forecasts from four conditional volatility models within a NN architecture and showed that NNs forecast accurately targeted variables during crisis periods. NNs were trained on the squared innovations deriving from a GARCH model (see Arneric, Poklepovic & Aljinovic (2014)), a setup subsequently extended by training a NN heterogeneous autoregression (HAR) with exogenous variables, to yield superior implied volatility forecasts (see Fernandes, Medeiros & Scharth (2014)).\n",

Fischer & Krauss (2017) deployed LSTM networks to predict out-of-sample directional movements on the S&P 500 and showed LSTM networks outperformed memory free classification methods, specifically a random forest and a logistic regression classifier. Ahmed, Smola, Wang, Xing, Zaheer & Zheng (2018) introduced a State Space LSTM (SSL) by generalizing the Latent-LSTM of Zaheer, Ahmed & Smola (2017). The main intuition of this work, motivated by state space models, was to learn dynamics in the state space, rather than in the sample space as per the LSTM RNN. The SSL was shown to be notably superior and more stable than Latent LSTM. Namin & Namin (2018) compared the performance of LSTM to ARIMA to forecast stock and index return time series with monthly stock and index data.  This research showed superior performance from LSTM, with average reduction in error rates obtained from LSTM of between 84-87 percent compared to ARIMA.\n",

    "Secondly, I summarize recent literature that forecast volatility with NNs.  Again, the LSTM RNN was the basis for much of this work. Xiong, Nichols & Shen (2016) used LSTM to forecast the volatility of equities data, incorporating data for 25 Google domestic trends as estimators. Working with daily OHLC equities data, this research showed that LSTM provided better predictions over a range of observation windows compared to linear ridge regression and autoregressive GARCH. Bucci (2019) compared the predictive performance of LSTM to to an autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average with the same set of explanatory variables (ARFIMAX) and without determinants (ARFIMA). Benchmarks further included a logistic smooth transition autoregressive model (LSTAR), also entailing exogenous variables (LSTARX), where the number of lags was set relying on the Akaike and the Bayesian Information criteria. This research used RV based on monthly S&P returns data, with volatility predictors assembled from a broad set of macroeconomic and financial variables. LSTM out-of-sample outperformed all the traditional econometric methods and out-of-sample comparisons showed that LSTM provided significant benefit in predicting relations that were expected to be nonlinear, such as between realized volatility and its determinants. Nguyen, Tran, Gunawan & Kohn (2019) introduced the LSTM-SV model, which used LSTM to model the long-term memory and non-linear auto-dependence in volatility dynamics that is not picked up by the classic SV model (Taylor (1982). This led to a prior distribution for the volatility process that was much more flexible than the AR(1) prior used by Taylor. LSTM-SV retained Taylor’s measurement equation and the linear part of the AR(1) process. The non-linear and long-memory parts were captured by the LSTM structure. Working with weekly stock return and daily exchange rate return time series, this research showed that the LSTM-SV model efficiently captured non-linear and long memory effects in stock and exchange rate returns and provided better out-of-sample forecasts than the standard SV model and a non-linearity N-SV model (Yu, Yang & Zhang (2006)). Petnehazi & Gall (2019) used LSTM to compare the forecasting performance of different volatility estimators based upon Daily OHLC data for equities and found only small differences in the predictive performance of close–to–close; Garman–Klass (1980), Parkinson (1980), Rogers–Satchell (1991), and Yang–Zhang (2000) volatility estimators using LSTM and daily OHLC data for equities.\n",

Almosova & Andresen (2019) researched average forecasting performance using inflation data and compared LSTM to an Auto-Regressive model, Random Walk model, Seasonal Auto-Regressive model, Markov-Switching model (MS-AR), and a NN. This research showed that LSTM outperformed all other forecasting techniques, especially at longer horizons, with the RMSFE being approximately one third to one halve of the errors for the classical models. This research also showed that the LSTM has a high degree of sensitivity to hyperparameters, a topic I return to in some detail in section 6.3 'Hyperparameter tuning'. Verstyuk (2019) performed a comparative analysis of LSTM and Vector Auto-Regressions (VARs) in an application to US data on GDP growth, inflation, commodity prices, Fed Funds rate and bank reserves. Verstyuk showed that LSTM dominates VAR in forecasting out-of-sample.  This research also showed that LSTM performed better in interpretability by means of impulse response functions: for example, a shock to the Fed Funds rate variable generated system dynamics that were more plausible according to conventional economic theory.\n",

    "Fourthly, I summarize recent literature in which high frequency data was used to forecast financial time series, stocks and volatilities, with deep NNs. Liu, Pantelous & Mettenheim (2018) proposed a hybrid HAR-RV-J-RNN model to forecast the realized volatility  of high frequency data with jumps. HF index data, sparsely sampled at 5-minutes, was used to compute RV based on a 20 year history and compared to the Heterogeneous AutoRegressive model of Realized Volatility with Jumps (HAR-RV-J) (Andersen, Bollerslev & Diebold, 2007) and a RNN. Liu, Pantelous & Mettenheim showed that all three models produced forecasts of similar quality. However, they also showed that the hybrid HAR-RV-J-RNN model and the RNN model were able to achieve the results with a shorter input time frame. Borovkova & Tsiamas (2019) proposed an ensemble of LSTM for intraday stock price direction predictions, using a large variety of technical analysis indicators as network inputs. This research used stacked LSTM NNs with layer normalization training on HF equities data (22 US large cap stocks), sampled at 5-minute intervals and observed over 1 year, to yield approximately 19,000 observations per stock.  This research built the LSTM ensemble with weighting of individual models proportionate to their recent performance, which allowed the authors to deal with potential non-stationarities in an innovative way. The predictions from each model were evaluated by the area under the curve (AUC) score of the receiver operating characteristic (see ROC; Kent, 1989).  With this set up, the proposed model was found to perform better than benchmark models, LASSO and ridge logistic classifiers, and equally weighted ensembles. Kim & Kim (2019) proposed a feature fusion long short-term memory convolutional neural network (LSTM-CNN), which combined features learned from different representations of the same data, namely prices time series and chart images of the same data. This research worked with HF equity ETF data sampled at 1-minute intervals to yield approximately 97,000 observations. Single models for CNN and LSTM respectively trained on the data showed that LSTM-CNN outperformed single LSTM and CNN models in stock price prediction.  A candlestick chart provided the best stock chart image for forecasting stock prices. This research showed that prediction error was efficiently reduced by using a combination of temporal and image features from the same data, rather than using these features separately.\n",

Few papers in the literature appear to do this systematically and comprehensively, and the best treatment I have found is that of Sherstinsky (2018, 2020). As with much of the most useful empirical DL literature, Sherstinsky's papers are not finance papers and considerable work is required to transcribe the most relevant aspects of it to a finance setting. Sherstinsky (2020) nevertheless provides the most thorough exposition of the necessary RNN and LSTM operations, using a signal processing framework. \n",

The loop of the RNN simply allows information to be passed sequentially through steps of the neural network, from one step to the next, thus creating a structure for sequential learning.  By unrolling a RNN (figure 2), I reveal its chain-like nature and intimate relation to sequences. Viewed in this way, the RNN is an obvious and compelling candidate for time series analysis. Sherstinsky unrolls the RNN, then proceeds to describe fully the training routines, FP, BP and GD, along with the numerical phenomenon of vanishing gradients, first described by Schmidhuber's student, Hochreiter in his PhD thesis (1991), and subsequently addressed in the seminal LSTM paper of Hochreiter & Schmidhuber (1997). Sherstinsky provides a particularly complete enunciation of FP, BP, and GD.  However, his overall framework is not particularly helpful from a finance perspective and considerable work is required to unpick it so that it readily ties back to the far briefer presentations that typify finance DL papers.\n",

    "By adapting the framework of Sherstinsky (2020) to complement and considerably extend finance DL literature, I have shown that the RNN, in canonical form (equation $\\ref{5.37}$) or equation $\\ref{5.39}$, essentially implements the backward Euler method for the ordinary DDE $\\ref{5.21}$. This 'forward' direction of starting in the continuous time domain (differential equation) and ending in the discrete domain (difference equation) implies that the phenomenon modeled by the econometrician is analog, and that it is modeled for purposes of realization in the discrete domain. For example, the source signal might be AAPL's price on the NYSE, as recorded on the NYSE TAQ. The orginal signal thus contains all information regarding the price of AAPL. The samples generated by a hypothetical discretization, governed in this model by equation $\\ref{5.21}$, could be captured as sparse samples , of the kind, for example, used in the empirical study (see sections 4 and 6). In this scenario, it is the sparsely sampled WMP that the RNN reproduces, not the actual price of AAPL. The key, if somewhat subtle, point in this scenario is that applying the RNN as a model implies that the price of AAPL is governed by equation $\\ref{5.21}$, so that the role of the RNN is that of implementing the computational method for solving this delay differential equation using the backward Euler discretization rule, under the restriction that the sampling time step, $\\Delta T$, is equal to the delay, $\\tau_0$. In contrast, the 'reverse' direction might be a more appropriate model in situations where the discrete signal is the natural starting domain, for example a situation where I am only able to obtain a dataset comprising, say, 1-minute, or 5-minute, or 10-minute samples of AAPL's price. While the starting point is data-dependent, both the continuous ('forward') and discrete ('reverse') representations may provide insight into the advantages and limitations of the models under consideration. \n",

I proceed now to the process of 'training' a RNN in order to obtain its weights, focusing upon equations $\\ref{5.80}$ and $\\ref{5.81}$. RNN systems suffer from so-called vanishing (or exploding) gradients. In section 3.1, Deep learning history and topography, I explained that Hochreiter (1991) originally showed that with standard activation functions, cumulative back-propagated error signals either shrank rapidly, or grew out of bounds. I also noted that much subsequent research, particularly in the 1990’s and 2000’s, was motivated by this insight (see for example Pascanu, Mikolov & Bengio (2013), Hochreiter, Bengio, Paolo & Schmidhuber (2001), Hochreiter & Schmidhuber (1997)). I explained in section 3.1 the historic context whereby truncated unrolled RNN systems, such as equation $\\ref{5.80}$, came to be  commonly trained using BP, adapted for sequences (see Werbos (1990, 1988) for detailed reviews). BP is quintessentially the repeated application of the chain rule of differentiation. \n",

    "I have shown in the earlier sections 5. Model, how, in the RNN system, $y_x$ is a normalized version of $h_x$. The weighted $y_x$ is fed back recursively as part of the update of $h_x$. The intimate relationship between $y_x$ and $h_x$ through this recursion directly impacts the gradient of $L$. The impact accumulates via training and results in the 'vanishing' (or more rarely 'exploding') gradient phenomena. The key insight of the long short-term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM RNN or LSTM) design is the incorporation of 'controls' directly into the network cell. The controls, which take the form of 'gates', may be trained in a manner that acts as a brake upon the gradient of the loss function with respect to $h$, i.e., the value that is proportional to parameter updates obtained from training by GD, and thus obviate the vanishing or exploding phenomena (see Schmidhuber (2015, 2013), Grossberg (2013), Perez-Ortiz, Gers, Eck, & Schmidhuber (2003), Hochreiter, Bengio, Paolo & Schmidhuber (2001), Gers, Schmidhuber & Cummins (2000), Hochreiter & Schmidhuber (1997)).

    "The longest compute time requirement for this research was 162:37:06 [hh:mm:ss], to estimate EURUSD with the comparison model, $\\mathrm{MSM} \\left( 13 \\right)$, using 13 volatility frequencies (i.e. $\\bar k = 13$, thus $\\mathrm{MSM} \\left( 13 \\right)$). The reason for the length of time taken may be explained as follows. Denote $M_t$ as a volatility state vector, where each component $M_{k, t}$ is a state variable. In section 6.2 'Comparison model $\\mathrm{MSM} \\left( \\bar k \\right)$' below I show that the econometrician observes the returns $x_t = \\sigma {\\left[ g \\left( M_t \\right) \\right]}^\\frac {1} {2} \\epsilon_t$, but not the vector $M_t$ itself; the vector $M_t$ is latent and thus inferred recursively by Bayesian updating. From an implementation perspective, the Bayesian recursion is one of two major obstacles to successful implementation of MSM with HF data (the other being the construction of the transition matrix $A$). Since it is not possible to vectorize the recursion, other means of speeding up the recursion must be found (NB: Vectorized code performs operations upon multiple components of a vector at the same time (in one statement) instead of looping. Vectorizing loops can be extremely difficult, but can reduce very long processing times to virtually instantaneous). In my review of the multifractal literature in the companion paper (Collins (2020)) I report that 13 of 31 multifractal papers used daily or weekly prices and 6 used simulated data only. 8 studies were theoretical and used no data. Only 5 studies used HF data (in these respects, i.e. the majority of studies use relatively small, tractable datasets, the multifractal literature is similar to the finance DL literature). Typically datasets used for estimating and forecasting MSM (and similarly LSTM) consisted of a few thousand observations. In this context, a recursion (loop) does not impose an unacceptable computational overhead. But with HF datasets approaching hundreds of thousands of observations or more, it very quickly becomes intractable, especially so when each iteration of the loop involves the fresh construction of a high-dimensional state space (i.e. a high value, say $\\geq 11$, has been ascribed to $\\bar k$). By contrast, comparable compute times for the LSTM were somewhat quicker. The LSTM network formulation is highly tunable in implementation, which enables more to be done in order to reduce compute times. The longest compute time requirement for the LSTM was 22:21:32, being the 2-day forecast for the EURUSD 1-minute HF dataset.\n",

    "The LSTM cell shown in figure 8 and fully defined by equations $\\ref{5.126}$ - $\\ref{5.136}$ is implemented as a network of many cells (thus NN).

An important theoretical result for LSTMs is that their formulation is general enough to represent any desired function (LeCun, Bengio, & Hinton (2015)). Given at least one hidden layer and a sufficiently large but finite number of cells, this is feasible by the arguments of the universal approximation theorem (see Hornik, Stinchcombe & White (1989)), whereby a function that is Borel measurable and defined over finite-dimensional spaces (thus continuous on a compact sub-set of $\\mathbb{R}^n$) can be approximated with arbitrary precision. By implication LSTMs may account for the non-linearity of the empirical phenomena being modeled. \n",

For this research I have of course sequential data, i.e. each observation is dependent upon the other observations immediately prior to it. Thus, one training example includes several (specifically, an arbitrarily selected, following considerable experimentation, 60, or one hour) of consecutive observations, ${\\left\\{ y_{t-1} \\right\\}}^{59}_{i=o}$. Predictions over the validation and testing sub-datasets were made multiple steps ahead. Non-linearity of LSTM warrants direct (as opposed to iterated) forecasts for each point in the prediction horizon (1-hour, 1-day, 2 day respectively, to align with the companion paper). I use gradient descent (see equations $\\ref{5.173}$ - $\\ref{5.182}$), with an arbitrarily, again following considerable experimentation, 32 training examples per batch. Then, 1 training cycle (or 'epoch') is composed of a full run through the training dataset, thus feeding the training examples for all possible $t$.

    "From theory, it is known that an insufficiently sized LSTM underfits data. Standard statistical fit measures demonstrate poor performance, even in-sample. Conversely, too large a LSTM may overfit the data and statistical fit measures will demonstrate strong performance in-sample, but collapse out-of-sample. In the latter case, the econometrician may regard the LSTM as having memorized the data without learning its high level structure and thus acquiring the ability to generalize the accumulated knowledge. Architecture size and structure in the empirical setting is therefore based upon exploration, which amounts to experimenting with different model specifications. This exploration may be guided by the relative predictive performance of the specifications considered. Usually, predictive fit is determined upon a data sample separate and distinct from training (in-) and testing (out-of-) samples. In practice, it is generally easier to start with a larger LSTM, allowing for redundancy and erring toward an excess of parameters, to then restrict excessive depth/width via regularization. Somewhat counter-intuitively, deep architectures also tend to be easier to implement and cheaper to train (i.e. faster with less computational overhead). \n",

    "An important role is played by training and regularization techniques (see for example, Srivastava, Hinton, Krizhevsky, Sutskever & Salakhutdinov (2014)). Regularization improves generalization of a LSTM and addresses potential overfit in the model. Literature describes many regularization techniques (for example, see Goodfellow, Bengio & Courville (2016) and Chollet (2018)). Those generally regarded as most effective are based upon the working presumption that good models are invariant to small perturbations. Dropout is a widely use regularization method that adds noise to the LSTM architecture (Srivastava, et al. (2014)). During a dropout training process, units and connections are randomly dropped, usually from hidden layers, but under some circumstances from visible layers too. Dropout is loosely analogous to model averaging (Srivastava, et al. (2014) develop the analogy). Data augmentation is an alternative regularization method that encourages fitting to relevant features of the data, as distinct from irrelevant noise. In a data augmentation process, data is expanded with synthetic data comprising the original data plus contaminants, usually in the from of Guassian/white noise. \n",

    "Loss minimization algorithms (Goodfellow, Bengio & Courville (2016) provide an extensive review) are usually variations of a standard gradient descent with some added stochasticity. The granularity of data inputs used for gradient computations and parameter updates may vary from the use of a full dataset (\"batch gradient descent\") to several (\"mini-batch gradient descent\") or single (\"stochastic gradient descent\") randomly chosen block(s) of observations. Using smaller batches prevents use of the most efficient computational tools and can lead to noisier convergence, but the built in stochasticity helps to avoid local minima and thus also works as a regularizer (Chollet (2018)). Minimization algorithms utilize efficient ways for computing gradients that improve upon the canonical chain rule (BP - see equations $\\ref{5.137}$ - $\\ref{5.172}$). Several methods may be used to ensure satisfactory convergence of minimization algorithms, that is, a convergence that is acceptably fast and avoids local minima. They include \"learning rate decay\", whereby parameters are updated in the face of stochasticity inherent in the minimization algorithm used, so that the learning rate is high far from the minimum in order to ensure fast learning, falling as the minimum is approached to prevent overshooting (i.e. \"learning rate decay\"). Parameter updating may be additionally employed to maintain memory of recent updates so that improvement continues in the most promising direction (\"momentum\" - see Bengio, et al. (2007)). Finally, though somewhat crude, the econometrician learns that an outright termination of the algorithm's iterations well before the minimum is reached can save a considerable amount of time and computational overhead with little downside (formalized as \"early stopping\", Prechelt (1997)). All of these methods again contribute to regularization.\n",

    "The LSTM literature outside of finance has generally shown that LSTM efficiently captures long-range memory and non-linear dependencies within various types of sequential data (see for example Lipton, Berkowitz, & Elkan (2015)).  LSTM literature thus provides a general consensus regarding the unreasonable effectiveness of NNs in a broader context (Karpathy (2015)). Possible explanations for this are multifarious, ranging from statistical physics (Mehta & Schwab (2014)), to geometry (Lei, Zhang & Artzi (2018)), information theory (Schwartz-Ziv & Tishby (2017)), and Bayesian statistics (see for example Patel, Nguyen & Baraniuk (2015)). This contrasts with finance, where research has generally shown that DL models, and NNs and LSTMs in particular, do not clearly outperform historically predominant deterministic and stochastic approaches. Verstyuk (2019) notes that without particular care to implementation (the 'AI trinity' data, compute, and algorithm (Anandkumar (2019)), DL models are generally shown to be less accurate than alternative statistical approaches in the financial time series literature. A recent extensive study by Gu, Kelly & Xiu (2019a) by contrast concludes that machine learning shows great promise for empirical asset pricing. These authors report similarly superior performance for NNs in an asset pricing context (Gu, Kelly & Xiu (2019b)).\n",

    "Section 3.2 'Deep learning in finance' includes six recent finance studies that focus upon LSTM in broadly comparable settings to my research and I recap the findings of these studies now. Generally LSTM outperforms comparison models; however, the comparison models may arguably be weaker than $\\mathrm{MSM} \\left( 13 \\right)$. Firstly, Almosova & Andresen (2019) examined average forecasting performance using inflation data and compared LSTM to several alternative models using rolling-window real time forecasts. This research showed that LSTM outperformed all other forecasting techniques, especially at longer horizons with the RMSFE being approximately one third to one halve of the errors for the benchmark models. Secondly, Borovkova & Tsiamas (2019) proposed an ensemble of LSTM for intraday stock price direction predictions, using a large variety of technical analysis indicators as network inputs. The LSTM ensemble operated in an online way, weighting the individual models proportionally to their recent performance, which allowed the authors to deal with potential non-stationarities in an innovative way. The performance of the models (the predictions of each model) was evaluated by the area under the curve score of the receiver operating characteristic (Kent, 1989) and the proposed model was found to perform better than the benchmark models or equally weighted ensembles. Thirdly, Bucci (2019) studied RV based on monthly S&P returns data (815 observations). Volatility predictors comprised a broad set of macroeconomic and financial variables. This research compared the predictive performance of LSTM to an autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average with the same set of explanatory variables (ARFIMAX) and without determinants (ARFIMA). Results showed that LSTM outperformed traditional econometric methods. Fourthly, Nguyen, Tran, Gunawan & Kohn (2019) introduced the LSTM-SV model, which used LSTM to model the long-term memory and non-linear auto-dependence in volatility dynamics beyond the basic SV model. This research studied weekly stock return and daily exchange rate return time series and showed that the LSTM-SV model efficiently captured non-linear and long memory effects in stock and exchange rate returns and provided better out-of-sample forecasts than a standard SV model (Taylor (1982)) and a non-linearity N-SV model (Yu, Yang & Zhang (2006)). Fifthly, Kim & Kim (2019) proposed the feature fusion long short-term memory convolutional neural network (LSTM-CNN), which combined features learned from different representations of the same data, namely prices time series and chart images of the same data. This research is probably closest to my research in terms of the data used for the study, which was a dataset of HF 1-minute equity ETF data (~97,000 observations). Single models for CNN and LSTM respectively were applied.  The research showed that LSTM-CNN outperformed the single LSTM and CNN models in stock price prediction.  Kim & Kim also showed that a candlestick chart provided the best stock chart image for forecasting stock prices.  These authors research showed that prediction error is efficiently reduced by using a combination of temporal and image features from the same data, rather than using these features separately. Finally, Fischer & Krauss (2017) deployed LSTM networks to predict out-of-sample directional movements on the S&P 500, modeling daily returns for S&P constituents and comparing LSTM to memory free classification methods, including a random forest, a NN, and a logistic regression classifier. This research showed that LSTM networks outperformed the memory free classification methods.\n",

    "I conclude with a summary of my main insights and contributions. My research extends the multifractal literature in three ways.  Firstly, I compare a deep learning model to a multifractal model, theoretically and empirically, and show that the deep learning and multifractal approaches have many similarities. The forward pass and backward propagation algorithms of the LSTM analogize to the transition matrix and Bayesian recursion of the $\\mathrm{MSM} \\left( \\bar k \\right)$, whilst the LSTM gradient descent training procedure analogizes to the basin-hopping optimization framework in my implementation of $\\mathrm{MSM} \\left( \\bar k \\right)$. Secondly, I provide a thorough derivation of the LSTM network, based upon the framework set out by Sherstinsky (2018, 2020), a step generally skipped in finance deep learning literature featuring the LSTM, to a level of detail that enables (re-)construction of all main algorithms of a LSTM network cell without recourse to an opensource deep learning framework. I thus provide a bridge finance DL literature and the denser theoretical treatment of the LSTM that is available in broader DL literature. Thirdly, I compare both models within the setting of big data, using a very large HF time series that has been thoroughly cleansed and prepared, has suppressed microstructure noise, and features extreme volatility regimes.\n",
